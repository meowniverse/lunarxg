# Estimated release date (stable)
This is a hard question to answer. We are currently in a rolling release phase, which is new ISO released weekly, with breaking changes. To be fair with you all, as of now the project only have [imchocomint](https://github.com/imchocomint) as the sole maintainer. We are in dire need of contributer to help us with stabilizing the system. We'd expect the stable release to be in early 2026, if there is still only one person who maintains it, and it wouldn't be half of the planned features. Of course, you can help us out by building packages and writing softwares.

# Thank you all

- You all, users and testers
